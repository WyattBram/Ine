# Ine Programming Language  

Ine is an interpreted, statically typed programming language designed for simplicity and efficiency. Leveraging a Pratt parser for its syntax analysis, Ine aims to provide an intuitive yet powerful programming experience for developers.  

## Features  

- **Interpreted**: Ine programs are executed directly, making development quick and straightforward.  
- **Statically Typed**: Type checking occurs at runtime, ensuring type safety without sacrificing performance.  
- **Pratt Parser**: The language uses a Pratt parser to handle syntax analysis, offering a flexible and extendable way to define grammar.
