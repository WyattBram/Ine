# Pratt Parser

This project implements a standalone **Pratt parser** for parsing mathematical and logical expressions. It includes a basic lexer and demonstrates how top-down operator precedence parsing can be used to build a simple and flexible parser.

## Features

- **Pratt Parser**  
  A clean implementation of top-down operator precedence parsing, suitable for interpreters and compilers.

- **Lexer**  
  Tokenizes input expressions to prepare them for parsing.

- **Educational Tool**  
  Designed for learning and experimenting with expression parsing techniques.
